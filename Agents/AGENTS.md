## Naming (zero exceptions)

The human’s name is **never** written as Kurt / kurt / kurtw — anywhere (code, UI,
docs, PRs, logs, comments, fixtures, paths).

| Context | Use |
| --- | --- |
| Notes, PRs, docs, runbooks, agent reports, UI labels for the human | **LinearThrone** |
| Copy Victoria reads or says about the human (system prompts, tool guidance, SMS preamble, confirmation asks) | **Kayleigh** |
| Unreal player pawn / MetaHuman asset named Kayleigh | keep as the **avatar** name (same person in-world) |

If you find a forbidden name, scrub it before merge. No aliases, no “historical”
exceptions in active product trees.

## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

SoulCore.AI ("House Victoria") is a single .NET 8 product: a persistent AI-companion
backend (`SoulCore.Host`, ASP.NET Core / Kestrel) that chats over a WebSocket protocol,
persists state in embedded SQLite, and optionally drives an Unreal Engine avatar. The
desktop client (`House/House.ChatDesktop`) is a thin GUI front-end built with
**Avalonia** (`net8.0`), so it is cross-platform (Linux, Windows, macOS).

Standard commands live in `SoulCore/README.md` (bind/health/WS, build, evidence CLIs).
Architecture / workflows / conventions: `docs/handbook/` (searchable: `cd docs-site && npm run docs:dev`).
Notes below are the non-obvious cloud/Linux caveats.

### My Machines (home PC; tablet scripts only)

Managed cloud VMs cannot touch LinearThrone’s LAN. For Host restarts, ChatDesktop WS,
and local probes, use **Cursor My Machines** on the **home PC**:

- Runbook: `docs/runbooks/cursor-my-machines.md`
- Home PC worker: `home-pc` → `@Agents/OPS-HOME.md`
- Tablet: native Termux **cannot** run Cursor CLI (`e_type: 2`) — keep SMS as
  Termux scripts / Tasker (`@Agents/OPS-TAB.md`). No `kayleigh-tab` worker yet.

Start home worker: `agent worker start --name home-pc` after Windows CLI install.
Dispatch from [cursor.com/agents](https://cursor.com/agents) picking **home-pc**.

### Build / test / lint (Linux VM)
- The **entire** `dotnet build SoulCore/SoulCore.sln` builds on Linux, including the Avalonia
  `House.ChatDesktop`. You can also build individual projects, e.g.
  `dotnet build SoulCore/SoulCore.Host/SoulCore.Host.csproj`.
- It is **not** a 0-warning build. `--no-incremental` reports **7 warnings** on `main`
  (a plain `dotnet build` under-reports, because unchanged projects are not recompiled):
  1 × `CS0618` obsolete `RadialGradientBrush.Radius` in `MainWindow.Presence.cs`,
  1 × `CA1416` Windows-only `VoiceSpeakService` in `VoiceServiceCollectionExtensions.cs`,
  5 × `CS1998` async-without-await in test files. Do not report "0 warnings" without
  running `--no-incremental` and counting.
- The Avalonia packages are pinned to the `11.3.x` line. Avalonia `12.x` was tried and its
  name generator did not emit `InitializeComponent`/`x:Name` fields under this SDK, so keep
  the desktop app on Avalonia 11.3.x unless you verify 12.x generates named controls.
- Tests: `dotnet test SoulCore/SoulCore.sln` runs both suites, no external services needed —
  `SoulCore.Protocol.Tests` (**716** on `main`, xUnit) and `House.ChatDesktop.Tests` (**6**).
  Run the whole solution, not just `SoulCore.Protocol.Tests.csproj`: `House.ChatDesktop.Tests`
  was missing from the `.sln` until now, so desktop tests were silently never executed.
- **4 of the 716 fail on `main`** (3 SMS/MMS security + 1 filesystem symlink containment).
  They are real product bugs, not flaky tests. Fixes are in flight on PR #95 and PR #97 —
  check whether they landed before treating a red suite as your own regression.
- Lint: there is no ESLint/analyzer config, and **no CI** — `.github/workflows/` does not
  exist on `main`, which is how 4 failing tests went unnoticed. PR #95 adds the gate.
  Until it lands, the only gate is what you run locally: `--no-incremental` build with the
  warning count above, `dotnet test SoulCore/SoulCore.sln`, and
  `dotnet format <project> --verify-no-changes`.

### Running the backend
- Run: `dotnet run --project SoulCore/SoulCore.Host -c Release`. Health: `GET
  http://127.0.0.1:7700/health`; WebSocket chat: `ws://127.0.0.1:7700/ws`.
- The Host **refuses any non-loopback bind** (SEC-004). Keep bind at `127.0.0.1`.
- The `SoulCore/scripts/*.ps1` startup/soak/E2E harnesses are PowerShell + Windows paths;
  `pwsh` is not installed here. On Linux, run the Host directly with `dotnet run` instead.
- Config overrides use env vars with the `SOULCORE_` prefix and `__` for nesting, e.g.
  `SOULCORE_Inference__Model` (see `SoulCore/.env.example`). Secrets can also go in
  `SoulCore/.env` (gitignored). Hermes env knobs are retired (BED-185) — Host forces them off.

### Running the desktop client (Avalonia GUI)
- Run: `dotnet run --project House/House.ChatDesktop -c Release`. It needs a graphical
  display; this VM has one at `DISPLAY=:1` (TigerVNC + xfce), so launch with
  `DISPLAY=:1 dotnet run ...`. It talks only to the Host on loopback (`/health` + `/ws`).
- Client endpoint overrides: `HOUSE_SOULCORE_HOST` / `HOUSE_SOULCORE_PORT`.

### Chat requires an LLM backend (gotcha)
- With defaults (`ChatWs:StubWhenModelDown=false`), a `chat.send` with no reachable LLM
  returns an `error` frame (`chat.model_down`), **not** a reply.
- The default `Inference:Model` in `appsettings.json` is a very large HF GGUF model that is
  not practical to pull in CI. To get real replies, run a local Ollama and override the
  model, e.g. start `ollama serve` (no systemd here — run it manually, e.g. in tmux), pull a
  small model like `qwen2.5:0.5b`, then run the Host with
  `SOULCORE_Inference__Model=qwen2.5:0.5b`.
- **Ollama Cloud (BED-187):** set `SOULCORE_Inference__BaseUrl=https://ollama.com`,
  `SOULCORE_OLLAMA_API_KEY`, and a tools-capable cloud `SOULCORE_Inference__Model`.
  Embeddings default to local `:11434` so VRAM stays free. Tool execution stays local.
- To exercise chat wiring without any LLM, set `SOULCORE_ChatWs__StubWhenModelDown=true` for
  deterministic stub replies (`provider=stub`).
- Built-in no-LLM evidence CLIs on the Host: `--emotion-roundtrip`, `--soul-loop-tick
  [--enabled]`, `--secrets-presence`, `--guestcontrol-probe`.

### Optional services
- **Ollama** (`:11434` and/or Cloud via BED-187) for real chat + tool-loop. Hermes gateway is
  **retired (BED-185)** — Host forces it off; open Chrome/websites with `desktop_open_app`,
  never Hermes MCP.
- Unreal Engine avatar bridge (`:8888`) is optional; the Host logs a warning and continues
  when it is unreachable (`unreal.connected=false` in `/health`).
- **victoria-sandbox (VirtualBox):** set `SOULCORE_VBOX_GUEST_USER=victoria` and
  `SOULCORE_VBOX_GUEST_PASS` (Ubuntu login password) in `SoulCore/.env`, then restart Host.
  Probe with `dotnet run --project SoulCore/SoulCore.Host -c Release -- --guestcontrol-probe`.
  Manual `VBoxManage guestcontrol … run --exe /usr/bin/whoami --` — do **not** pass the exe
  path again after `--` (that makes `id` report "no such user" after a successful logon).
