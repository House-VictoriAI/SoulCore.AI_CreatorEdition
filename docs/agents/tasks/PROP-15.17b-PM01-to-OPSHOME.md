# PROP-15.17b — Host recycle + lexi pin

1. Quit/freeze ChatDesktop (no Presence switcher on `:7700`).
2. Start current Release Host on `127.0.0.1:7700`.
3. Ensure lexi `inferenceModel=mother:latest`; activate lexi.
4. Gate `/health`: active lexi, `resolvedInferenceModel=mother:latest`, `modelSource=persona`.
